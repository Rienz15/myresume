<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>My name is Rienz (pronounced as Ree-yens), but friends often call me by my nickname, Renz.</p>

<p>I love learning new things. My bucket list includes learning at least 3 different human languages. I also am passionate about cooking, travelling, and eating! One of the things that interest me is web development.</p>

<p>I especially like minimalist website designs. If you like my designs, feel free to reach out and let's talk about how you'd like your website built.</p>
